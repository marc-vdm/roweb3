Since 2022, rOpenSci has been developing tools and processes to localize and translate our content. As a result of this effort, we created a set of guidelines to assist our community in translating and localizing our resources. 

We're excited to introduce the first version of the rOpenSci Localization and Translation Guidelines.

These guidelines explain the rationale behind and the process for localizing and translating our resources. They are designed to support community members contributing to the [multilingual publishing project](https://ropensci.org/multilingual-publishing/).

This guide is multilingual, offering both general and specific guidelines for translating and localizing our resources across all [active languages](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/translation_guide/?tab=readme-ov-file#languages-with-active-projects).

 

## Overview

The guide consists of six sections:

1. [Preface](https://translationguide.ropensci.org): A brief overview of the book's purpose, intended audience, the goals of the guidelines, and instructions on how to contribute.

2. [Motivation](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/motivation.html): This section explains the importance of localizing and translating our resources. It discusses the impact of language barriers, the principles of community-driven localization and translation, and how these activities contribute to community building.

3. [General Guidelines](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/intro.html): This section introduces the concepts of localization and translation, explaining how they enhance accessibility. It also outlines the technical infrastructure, work organization, and general aspects of the translation process.

4. [Translation and Review Guidelines](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/howtoreview.html): This section offers a detailed guide on translating and reviewing our resources. It covers how to contribute to a new or existing language project and manage the localization and translation process. It also provides technical and general review guidelines to ensure translation quality.

5. [Specific Guidelines](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/specific_guidelines.html): This chapter varies by language. It contains specific guidelines for localizing and translating content based on community agreements. For instance, the rules defined by the Spanish-speaking community may differ from those of the English-speaking community. This section also addresses the localization of citations, code, diagrams, and data, and includes a glossary.

6. [NEWS](https://translationguide.ropensci.org/booknews.html): This section documents all changes made to the guidelines in each version.


## Next steps

This guide is designed for those interested in localizing rOpenSci materials or contributing to the maintenance of localized content. It is also useful for anyone tasked with localizing material for another community or group. We hope that our processes, agreements, and lessons learned can benefit other communities as well.

The guide is available in English and Spanish, with plans to translate it into other languages, like Portuguese.
